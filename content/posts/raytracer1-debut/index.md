# My Entry into Ray Tracing:  "Sanctuary"

I embarked on my ray tracing journey with the creation of the "Sanctuary" raytracer, a project born out of the Chaos Camp ray tracing course.

Hereâ€™s a video showcasing what "Sanctuary" can do:

Looking ahead to 2024, the plan is to accelerate "Sanctuary" with CUDA, introduce a graphical interface (as of now, it outputs directly to a .png file), and add some rasterization capabilities.
