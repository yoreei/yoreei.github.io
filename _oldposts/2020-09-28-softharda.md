East Bulgarian apparently makes a distinction between soft "a" and a hard "a" sounds, following the same rules as Russian. Do note, that the vowel qualities are still very different from Russian.

The "a" in баня noticeably backer than a Sofian pronunciation and the "a" in ям is noticeably fronter.  I would describe the east hard "a" as similar to the one in Standard German, which I also believe to be the same as the LOT vowel in Standard American (unmerged).
TODO: draw on vowel chart and compare the soft a to some other sound I know.
